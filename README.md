Student organizations make up a significant part of many students’ university lives. Given organizations’ interest to widen their reach, especially in the online setting, DLSU’s student organizations mostly have individual social media profiles and websites, showcasing their background, events, and activities. 

However, some students might find it difficult and inefficient to search for organizations’ profiles one by one. Furthermore, they may not even be aware of the existence nor the projects of certain organizations they could possibly be interested in.

With that, the group’s Web Application, the DLSU Student Organization Hub, aims to provide students of De La Salle University a platform to check the organizations they are interested in, through one unified and streamlined web platform. It would allow the different organizations to show the students what they have to offer through their own page within the web application. 

Unlike most similar initiatives, the web application would be accessible all year round even outside the timeframe of recruitment periods like the Annual Recruitment Week (ARW) and Student Government Annual Recruitment (SGAR). The application will behave similarly to a social media application, however, it is exclusively for student organizations. Moreover, student organizations and individual students will have different kinds of accounts, with different available features to each account type.

# How to run the DLSU Organization Hub Web App
